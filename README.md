# Online Math Solver Example

This project is an intentionally incomplete online math solver.

## Motivation

This repository was created to help mathematicians in the graduate-level Purdue course "[Fundamentals of Programming For Mathematicians](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~bradfor3/ProgrammingFundamentals/)" learn the basics of GitHub - specifically, how to:

- Fork Projects
- Collaborate with peers using GitHub
- Create and use topical branches
- Push code to GitHub
- Submit pull requests to contribute to projects

## How-To

This project is meant to be used by a small group.

One user will fork the project using the GitHub `fork` button, and invite the other users to be **collaborators**.

Users will create **feature branches** specific to each new solver they write.

Then, as a group, they will **merge** them into their forked project's **master** branch.

To finish the project, students in the course will submit a **pull request** to this main project.

## Installation

To install, clone the repository with `git clone` as described in class.

Then, install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And launch the `solver_website.py` file:

```bash
python solver_website.py
```

Then open your web browser to the server, likely `localhost:5000`.
